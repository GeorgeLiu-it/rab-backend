What is the FFF Group?
The Inquisition Society · FFF Group, commonly known as the "FFF Group," is an organization from the light novel Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu and its derivative works. It was founded by Class 2-F of Fumizuki Academy High School, functioning as an Inquisition Court. The leader is "Daliangzai," and their outfit includes a giant grim reaper scythe, a full black robe (actually a cloak with a hood), and a mask marked with the letter F.

The FFF Group first appeared in Volume 4 of the novel published in 2008, which predates its anime adaptation (announced in 2009 and aired in January 2010). So the Inquisition Society itself is not an anime-original creation.

What is the background of the FFF Group’s founding?
Due to the lack of female students in their class and their unpopularity with the opposite gender, the male students of Class 2-F banded together to form the FFF Group. It serves as a student-run court, where complaints from other students within Fumizuki Academy are reviewed through trials and sentencing.

The organization grew rapidly—starting from just Class 2-F members, it eventually expanded to include 60% of the male students across all grade levels (and continued growing). The group also offers salaries and rewards (such as photos of "Xiaoming and Hideyoshi"), thanks to major financial sponsorship from the "Silent Merchants".

How many members are in the FFF Group?
There are 830 members in total. The leader is Daliangzai, and key members include Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Wu, Zhao Liu, Li Lili, and Zhong Lingling.

Who is the leader of the FFF Group?

What is the mascot of the FFF Group?
The mascot is Eve, also nicknamed F-chan or Judgment-chan. Her representative letter is "F", though there’s debate about whether she’s a decoration on someone's head or a mysterious ahoge (stray hair) on her twin tails.

Eve is a silver-haired, red-eyed twin-tailed loli. She is extremely shy, rarely speaks in front of others, and struggles with social interactions. However, with close friends, she can be unexpectedly cheerful and goofy, even showing hidden mischievous traits.

How do you join the FFF Group?
There are no specific requirements or restrictions for joining the FFF Group—meaning, if you want to join, you're in! Whether or not you're single doesn’t really matter.
